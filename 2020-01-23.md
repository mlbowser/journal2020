To do:

* ~~Get draft Sandpiper Elodea RFP to Steve.~~
* earthworm correspondence.
* Take A-110 class.

I completed a draft Sandpiper Lake elodea RFP.

I found photos of Elizabeth Bella, Donna Handley, and Nate Olson surveying Vogel Lake using throw rakes to look for *Elodea* on August 14, 2013. None was found.

There has been some population genetics work done on *Elodea* [@kadono_genetic_1997; @gross_unterscheidung_2003; @huotari_population_2011; @huotari_comparative_2013].

I submitted to Alaska DNR a Permitting Quarantined Species Transport/Import Request for collecting Elodea specimens from Sandpiper Lake.

Lisa Saperstein sent me a copy of Lipkin [-@lipkin_investigation_2007] relating to fire in alpine tundra.
