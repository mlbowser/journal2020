To do:

* ~~Worm information to ADF&G.~~
* ~~Submit Slikok manuscript.~~
* Review this week's *Refuge Notebook* article.

The Slikok manuscript made it through the technical review. I submitted it to the journal.

Tyler sent me more coordinates of *Lumbricus* locations in Alaska, from which I made updated maps.

I worked on putting together information for the ADF&G comments on a proposed regulation on *Lumbricus* species worms, getting a draft sent at the end of the day.
