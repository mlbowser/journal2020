## Wedesday, January 8

To do

* Submit *Refuge Notebook* article for this week.

I worked on my *Refuge Notebook* article, getting it submitted.

I entered data for *Hypnoidus bicolor* specimen [KNWR:Ento:11363](http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11363). There was not a previusly entered georeferenced record from the Refuge.
