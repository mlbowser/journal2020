To do:

* *Refuge Notebook* article
* Sandpiper Elodea RFP
* earthworm correspondence
* ~~blackfish permit reporting~~

I summarized the work done on blackfish in 2019 and got the required project summary and data sent in.

Blackfish collected in 2019:

lat|lon|date|age|number
|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:|
60.56993|-151.19294|2019-06-27|juvenile|1
60.559862|-151.187067|2019-08-22|juvenile|4
60.559265|-151.187372|2019-08-23|juvenile|1

For the *Refuge Notebook* article on fire in tundra I checked Langille's report [@langille_proposed_1904]. Although he talked about fire in Canyon Creek and other places, no mention was made of fire making it up into the alpine.

I found the mention of fire in tundra in the 2014 Funny River Fire [@morton_ghosts_2014].

The 1991 Pothole Lake Fire burned into the alpine to 1012 m judging from the fire polygon and digital elevation model. I found the KNWR documents from the Pothole Lake Fire. This fired did burn into the alpine to 3000 ft. in multiple places.

LTEMP plot 3220 was in the Pothole Lake fire. So was plot 3204. Plot 3204 was burned forest in 2004. Plot 3220 was lush alder, *Calamagrostis*, and cow parsnip in 2004. Neither was in tundra.

The Funny River Fire made it to about 2100 ft.

The 1950 Big Indian Creek fire burned to about 3000 ft. in the alpine based on the fire history GIS layer.

Later at home I continued work on this *Refuge Notebook* article.
