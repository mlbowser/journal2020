* Get updated prescription for Sandpiper Lake.

I received the technical review evaluation for the Slikok manuscript. There are a number of requests for changes to the supplementary files.

I started a *Refuge Notebook* article on *Entomobrya nivalis*. I went on a short walk looking for *E. nivalis* under bark of birches, cottonwoods, and spruces. I found other arthropods, but no springtails.

I restarted writing a *Refuge Notebook* article, this time Walter Evans' 1897-1898 agricultural exploration of southern Alaska.
