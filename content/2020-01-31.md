To do:

* ~~BDJ Slikok manuscript revision.~~
* Enter data from blackfish specimens.
* Sandpiper Lake *Elodea* EA.

I revised the BDJ manuscript and submitted a draft to the journal.

At 10:30 my supervisors and I met to discuss goals and plans for 2020 and beyond.

Priority projects or me:

* Perform an occupancy analysis of the Slikok project invertebrate data and publish this.
* Sandpiper Lake *Elodea* eradication.
* Swan Lake Fire burn severity/vegetation plots.

One of my supervisors wants to see an assessment of the 2004–2006 Long Term Ecological Monitoring Program, wanting to know what we learned from it and when—if ever—such an effort should be repeated. I expressed that we are at least planning on publishing datasets from this project.

My supervisors did think it would be appropriate to collaborate with ADF&G to sample invertebrates in the Miller Creek drainage ahead of expected pesticide applications.
