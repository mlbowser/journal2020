Annaleese and I drove out to Hakala plot HAK3 to survery it. We had to begin by locating as much of the original rebar as we could, then pound in enough replacement rebar where needed to make it so that we could survey it well.

HAK3 had been burned in the 2015 Card Street fire, killing all standing trees, but not burning deeply into the soil. It was now full of aspen suckers, downed trees, and grasses. This was a difficult place to work, so surveying this plot took the day.
