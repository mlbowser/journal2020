To do:

* Slikok occupancy.

I continued working on formatting the *Bombus* article for the *AKES Newsletter*, finishing this at the end of the day. I sent a draft of this article to the authors for review and I sent the whole issue out the editorial committee for review.

I added *Deschampsia beringensis* to the Refuge's species list based on UAM Herbarium specimens.
