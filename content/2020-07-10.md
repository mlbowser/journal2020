Ed, Sarah, Dawn, and I surveyed Hakala plot HAK7 in a black spruce muskeg. Difficulties here illustrated problems with trying to use individual counts of some of these species. Especially with specie like grasses and *Ledum*, it was difficult to recognize individuals. For *Vaccinium vitis-idaea* we used basically a stem count. For *Ledum palustre* and grasses we used clumps of individuals, yielding a much smaller number than the stem count. I much prefer point intercept counts for quantifying abundance.

In the afternoon we proceeded to plot HAK8, a much easier plot to deal with because the understory was extremely sparse. Mark joined us here. 

While others worked on HAK8, Dawn and I drove over to HAK9 to see how it had been affected by the fire. We found that it had not been burned even though the fire had reached to within less than 10 meters from the plot in places. This was a rich, moist, lush plot.
