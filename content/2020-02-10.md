I worked on the [Kenai National Wildlife Refuge's checklist](https://github.com/mlbowser/KenaiNWRspecies), adding a minimal checklist export.

I sorted Berlese sample [KNWR:Ento:11364](http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11364). I cut off sorting at a 2 hour limit. Most material had been sorted. A small number of Collembola and mites remained and were discarded.

Araneae|12
Collembola|110

I learned today that we had purchased herbicide last fall. I inventoried our aquatic herbicides. We have 41 pails of SonarOne, (20 lbs. each), a total of 820 lbs. We have 20 boxes of Littora (5 gal. each), a total of 100 gal. of Littora.

I revised the *Elodea* RFP based on these numbers.
