I worked on the [Kenai National Wildlife Refuge's checklist](https://github.com/mlbowser/KenaiNWRspecies), adding a minimal checklist export.

I sorted Berlese sample [KNWR:Ento:11364](http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11364). I cut off sorting at a 2 hour limit. Most material had been sorted. A small number of Collembola and mites remained and were discarded.
