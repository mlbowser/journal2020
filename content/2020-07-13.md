Ed sent me his notes and photos from the Hakala plots. He and Sarah did survey plot HAK9 on Saturday.

I started on a *Refuge Notebook* article on *Sunira verberata* for this week.

I learned that *Sunira verberata* was documented defoliating *Viburnum edule* and consuming cultivated crops in 1976 in Alaska [@interagency_arctic_research_coordinating_committee_department_1977], but the specific locality was not given. The authors reported that disease and parasitism killed some of the larvae.
