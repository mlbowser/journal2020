to do

* ~~Notes from yesterday~~
* ~~Edit *Refuge Notebook* article~~
* ~~Review non-native species list.~~
* Get snowshoe hare project metadata ready for Thursday meeting.

I edited this week's *Refuge Notebook* article, getting it sent off.

I started an Arctos project for this year's vegetation work following the Swan Lake Fire (<https://arctos.database.museum/project/10003388>).

Now I need to review the list of non-native terrestrial invertebrates of Alaska, updated data from the earlier list [@simpson_list_2019].

```r
## Comparing the new list to the previous version.
wd <- "D:/projects/non-native_species/2020_comprehensive_list_review"
setwd(wd)

old <- read.csv("Non-native_Master_V2-0_20190912.csv", colClasses="character")
new <- read.csv("NNSL_AK-HI-L48_V3_2020-06-10_ForReview.csv", colClasses="character")

select_old <- (old$Region == "AK") &
 (old$Kingdom == "Animalia")
old_animals <- old[select_old, 1:33]

dim(old_animals)
[1] 142  33

select_new <- (new$Region == "AK") &
 (new$Kingdom == "Animalia")
new_animals <- new[select_new, 1:33]

dim(new_animals)
[1] 142  33

setdiff(old_animals$scientificName, new_animals$scientificName)
character(0)

setdiff(new_animals$scientificName, old_animals$scientificName)
character(0)
## It appears that there are no differences in the lists of species.

write.csv(new_animals, "2020-07-28-1456_AK_animals.csv", row.names=FALSE)
```

I edited the record for *Eisenia fetida*, added *Eisenia andrei*, and got these edits to Annie.
