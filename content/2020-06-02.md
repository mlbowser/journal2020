
## Tuesday, June 2

To do:

* Fill out a USFWS Alaska Region 2020 field project go/no go screening matrix and individual project safety plan for the Swan Lake Fire burn severity and vegetation response project. 
* Submit this week's *Refuge Notebook* article.
* *Refuge Notebook* catch-up.
* Revise aquatic herbicide PUPs.
* Improve Kenai NWR checklist processing/formatting.
* Slikok occupancy.
* Finish 2019 black spruce project.

I started completing a field project plan for the Swan Lake Fire burn severity and vegetation response project that is now required under the current COVID-19 situation.

```r
Filling in taxonomy again.

source("make_DWC-A.R")

sl <- dwc1[,3]=="" | 
 dwc1[,4]=="" | 
 dwc1[,5]=="" | 
 dwc1[,6]=="" | 
 dwc1[,7]=="" |
 dwc1[,8]==""

## Filling in genera.
slg <- dwc1$genus == ""
spt <- strsplit(dwc1$scientificName[slg], " ")
genus <- sapply(spt, "[", 1)
dwc1$genus[slg] <- genus
 
## Saving this to manually edit. 
write.csv(dwc1[sl,], "../data/taxonomy_fill-ins_new.csv", row.names=FALSE)
```

I see that some of the distribution information is missing for some species.

```r
## Generate a distribution file.
dist1 <- data1[,c(
 "ID",
 "locality",
 "occurrenceStatus",
 "Origin"
 )]

 head(dist1)
## The species with ID 654758 has a missing Origin value of "".

levels(as.factor(dist1$Origin))
[1] ""           "Native"     "Non-native"

missing_origin <- data1[data1$Origin=="" & data1$taxonRank=="species",]
nrow(missing_origin)
[1] 458 ## That is a lot.

## Saving this to deal with it. 
write.csv(missing_origin, "../data/missing_origin.csv", row.names=FALSE)
```

I worked on generating pdf output of the checklist, getting a first iteration done.

Later I received two independent reports of thousands of caterpillars off of the Marsh Lake Trail. I looked through caterpillar images. I think they are noctuids, maybe Hadeninae.
