To do:

* Spruce data/analysis to John.

Today I received fluridone concentrations results from samples collected at Sandpiper Lake on August 28.

I did a little working adding records to FWSpecies.

Mark had posted video footage from the ROV in Sandpiper Lake on August 28. It showed brittle, yellow, *Elodea* that broke apart when the ROV passed through it. Interestingly, the native *Potamogeton* species in the images did not appear to be as heavily damaged as the *Elodea*.

I filled out the online submission form for fungal samples via the [Fungal Diversity Survey](https://fundis.org/), packaged the specimens, and drove them to FedEx Kenai (tracking #: 815820190845). 

I participated in a USFWS Vogel Lake/Miller Creek NEPA discussion call. I plan to supply species occurrence data for this.

I imported the remaining 2020 snowshoe hare pellet count data. I also worked on organizing the data and revising the metadata.
