I finished some editing for the upcomeing *AKES Newsletter*.

I formatted the *Refuge Notebook* article form December 27, 2019 and started with 2020 articles.

### Biology check-in at 11:00

I attempted to attend a 13:30 meeting about the Mystery Creek gravel pit rehabilitation, but the connection was too poor.

### AKEPIC meeting at 14:00

I formatted and posted *Refuge Notebook* articles through January 17.
