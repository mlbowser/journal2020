<!-- 06:45-17:00 -->

I came in early to take care of notes, charge batteries, etc.

I spent the day off of the Sterling Highway and Mystery Creek with Lisa, Dawn, and Amanda. We worked on more combined burn index plot training.

Our first plot was FE-SWAN-18 northeast of Egumen Lake. This ended up being unburned black spruce swamp.

On the way back to the truck we found some orchids that were unfamiliar to me. Back at the office I identified these as *Galearis rotundifolia* (iNaturalist: [51766406](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/51766406)).

We had lunch at Picnic Lake. There were lots of bryozoans under the rocks in the water.

Our next plot was KE-SWAN-21 east of Picnic Lake. This was black spruce forest that was a bit more moderately burned than what we had looked at yesterday. More duff remained and more plants were resprouting.

Our last plot for the day was KE-SWAN-19 near the south end of Mystery Creek Road. This was again in well-drained black spruce forest, but this had been even more moderatly burned, with many willows, some aspen, and many *Betula glandulosa* resprouting. We did not have time to complete the CBI protocols here; we just looked at it before leaving the field.
