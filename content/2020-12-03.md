I edited the snowshoe hare dataset metadata for import to GBIF via USGS' IPT.

I submitted the PUP usage report SonarONE, but I could not complete the usage report or Littora because I failed to find it in search tool.

I tried to get more budget info from the Sandpiper Lake elodea eradication project for the FY20 Summary Report on Invasive Species Projects.

I added recently-obtained *Aporrectodea* sequences and the four sequences identified as *Aporrectodea limicola* on [BOLD](http://boldsystems.org/) to the FASTA file I had made on [March 12](#thursday-march-12). This is submitted to [NGPhylogeny.fr](https://ngphylogeny.fr/) using the FastME/OneClick analysis (results: <https://ngphylogeny.fr/workspace/history/c27e903be4666575>).

I identified speicmen [KNWR:Inv:50](https://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Inv:50) and [KNWR:Inv:51](https://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Inv:51) as *Aporrectodea caliginosa* lineage L3. 

I downloaded a couple of additional sequences from Arctos and re-ran the analysis (<https://ngphylogeny.fr/workspace/history/8465048aa002edee>).

Phylogenetic tree including recent worm sequences.

[KNWR:Inv:25](https://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Inv:25) and [UAM:Ento:362505](https://arctos.database.museum/guid/UAM:Ento:362505) are also Aporrectodea caliginosa* lineage L3.

The problem with the PUP was resolved and I submitted the usage report for Littora.

I started work on reformatting the snowshoe hare data as occurrence data.
