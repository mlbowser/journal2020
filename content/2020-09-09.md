To do:

* ~~Edit and submit this week's *Refuge Notebook* article.~~

I entered data of dates and observers from 2014 snowshoe hare work.

I edited and sent off this week's *Refuge Notebook* article.

### KPCWMA meeting @ 10:00

I provided an update via chat: We found three species records that are, to the best of my knowledge, new records for the Kenai Peninsula:

Sagittaria cuneata
This species is native to Interior Alaska, but we believe it is not native to Southcentral Alaska and that it was likely introduced by users of the Swan Lake Canoe Trail.

Amaranthus sp., I think Amaranthus retroflexus
https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/55658833
https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/55433248

Veronica peregrina
https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/57466121
https://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Herb:12444

We should be submitting all of these except the Sagittaria to AKEPIC this winter with our annual data submission.

I started to look at snowshoe hare density data in preparation for a *Refuge Notebook* on this article for next week.

Berge and Gese [-@berg_relationship_2010] found a relationship of hare density (hares/ha) = 0.0921 X (pellets/m2yr) + 0.0524 in Wyoming.
