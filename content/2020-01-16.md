I picked up some historical documents from the fisheries office, scanned them, and filed them. There is a record of elodea from Vogel Lake from 1964. I think this might have been a misidentification of *Hippuris*, but it is hard to know. A thorough survey was done on Sandpiper Lake, but no elodea was documented there. Later I returned these documents.
