I have the following JHAs to complete.

I finished a draft of the blackfish diet article.

At our last early adopter data managmeent meeting, I had recorded that next steps are to complete three product medata records and to make a data dictionary. I made a data dictionary im mdEditor and added metadata records for all data/products that I have in the directory right now.

### Vogel Lake/Miller Creek Field Work meeting at 13:00

* No field work can be done until May 1 at the earliest.
* I learned that a plume of low salinity freshwater from the Susitna River comes straight across to Point Possession, making a viable possibility for pike to get to the northern Kenai across the salt water.

In the evening I drove to the office, where I picked up a microscope and other equipment so that I can process Berlese soil samples at home.
