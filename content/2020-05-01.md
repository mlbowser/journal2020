To do:

* Intra-Service Section 7 Biological Evaluation Form

Responding to comments on iNaturalist (<https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/3815139>), I looked into *Dilophus femoratus* Meigen, 1804. From Skartveit [-@skartveit_larvae_2002]:

> Eurytopical species, most common on flower-rich meadows. Common up to the subalpine zone. Full-grown larvae found in March to June.

Interestingly, the Alaskan material identified as *D. femoratus* is different than European *D. femoratus*. The two BINs for these are not nearest neighbors based on BOLD's BIN algorithm. This deserves looking into.

BIN including Alaskan material:\

BIN including Palearctic D. femoratus:\

I found old correspondence and updated identifications of all biobionid specimens identified by John Skartveit in 2006.

I downloaded all *Dilophus* COI sequences and one *Bibio* sequence (outgroup) and submitted these to NGPhylogeny.fr (<https://ngphylogeny.fr/workspace/history/30d01ce00572c3b7>).

I worked on the Intra-Service Section 7 Biological Evaluation Form for the Sandpiper Lake *Elodea* eradication project.
