A fly collected from within a house (iNaturalist: [41528440](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/41528440)) is *Bradysia ocellaris*. This is a cosmopolitan pest of greenhouses that can damage plants according to Broadley et al. [-@Broadley_et_al_2018]. This may be the first report of *B. ocellaris* from Alaska.

A fly larva collected from a seep near the Kasilof River on [April 4](#saturday-april-4) (iNaturalist: [41531388](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/41531388)) is [Limoniidae sp. BOLD:ACR8073](http://boldsystems.org/index.php/Public_BarcodeCluster?clusteruri=BOLD:ACR8073). It is a 100% match with three specimens from the Yukon, but these have not been identified beyond family level.

A larva collected from a volunteering *Brassica* sp. leaf in a high tunnel on June 10 in Kasilof was identified as *Rhigognostis interrupta*. I did not find out much about this species' biology.
