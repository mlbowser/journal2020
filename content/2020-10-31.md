I formatted and posted the *Refuge Notebook* article from May 15. I also made an update to [*Biology News*](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Kenai/what_we_do/science/biology-news.html).

I found that I need to fix a link in Bowser and Bowser [-@BowserBowser2020]. The doi for the first image links to a different image on Arctos, I think likely related to Arctos' data loss and/or subsequent upgrade this year. Also, I should add citations for all specimens related to this article.
