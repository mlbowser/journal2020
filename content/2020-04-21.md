To do:

I did get a proposal to Mark for building capacity to do some DNA work in house.

### Safety committee meeting at 09:00

* We need to be checking in on the radio when we go out in the field.

I started entering tally data from the 2019 black spruce sweep net samples.

I finished editing this week's *Refuge Notebook* article.

I posted the [January 24 *Refuge Notebook* article](https://www.fws.gov/uploadedFiles/Region_7/NWRS/Zone_2/Kenai/Sections/What_We_Do/In_The_Community/Refuge_Notebooks/2020_Articles/Refuge_Notebook_v22_n04.pdf).

I inventoried and packaged the Berlese samples from the 2019 black spruce work.

I attempted multiple times to attend the Biologists' teleconference this afternoon, but I failed to get through.
