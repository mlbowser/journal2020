To do:

* Compile data from sweep and Berlese samples.
* Slikok occupancy?
* Edit this week's *Refuge Notebook* article.
* ~~Proposals for 2019 to Mark?~~
* Contract for fluridone.
* Review Rob's pike treatment plan.

I did get a proposal to Mark for building capacity to do some DNA work in house.
