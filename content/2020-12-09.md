I did some literature review regarding primers and methods for metabarcoding diet of birds. Todd had collected a fecal sample from a Rufous Hummingbird that we are interested in having processed using metabarcoding methods. It still looks like the old ZBJ-ArtF1c and ZBJ-ArtR2c primer set [@zeale_taxon-specific_2011] is still a good option. It looked good in a recent comparision of primer sets for this kind of work [@tournayre_silico_2020]. While this primer pair is good for identifying arthropods, it does not amplify vertebrate DNA well, so it would not be good for identifying predators from fecal samples where the predator was not known. It should work well in this case, though. I requested a quote from [Mr. DNA Lab](https://www.mrdnalab.com) for processing a single, tiny fecal sample.

I received, edited, and sent off this week's *Refuge Notebook* article.

I started work on moving *Refuge Notebook* articles to ServCat by first extracting a bibliography from zotero, a bibliographical dataset from 2016. I tried entering one record into ServCat as a trial run.

I started trying to a biological assessment for land exchange. I received summary data on habitat types. I found that the classification used [@usda_forest_service_alaska_region_kenai_2019; @bellante_kenai_2020] did not have definitions of the habitat types.
