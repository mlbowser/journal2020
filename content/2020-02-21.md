To do:

* ~~Board of fish comments?~~
* ~~Sandpiper Lake snowmachine decision/logistics.~~
* Board of Fish meeting travel arrangements.

I learned today that Juniki Yukawa and others published a paper including Dominqiue Collet's work on *Rabdophaga* willow rosette gall makers [@Sato_et_al_Rabdophaga_2020]. I am happy to see this published.

I composed and submitted comments regarding the use of *Lumbricus* earthworms as live bait for the upcoming Board of Fisheries meeting.

I sorted Berlese sample [KNWR:Ento:11370](http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11370).
