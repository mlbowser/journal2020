To do:

* ~~Submit this week's *Refuge Notebook* article.~~
* ~~Data managmenet follow-up.~~
* Prepare information/comment for next week's BOF meeting.

I finished my *Refuge Notebook* article and got it sent in.

I created an entry for the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge Snowshoe Hare Grid Surveys project using [mdEditor](https://www.mdeditor.org/) and sent this to the data management folks.
