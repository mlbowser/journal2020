As of this morning that PIPITS analysis is still on the ITSx step.

Yesterday I saw that we have some *Rabdophaga* willow rosette galls on *Salix pulchra* and *Salix fuscescens* in the swamp behind our house. I had been looking for rosette galls on *S. fuscescens* last year because it looked like there might possibly be a difference between COI sequences of *Rabdophaga* gall makers on these two hosts based on previous work.
