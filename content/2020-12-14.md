I completed the fleet card training for cardholders.

I stopped by the office today to some computer/account maintenance taskds and to pick up a hummingbird fecal sample that Todd had left for me in the freezer.

I entered the sample into Arctos ([KNWR:Env:27](https://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Env:27)) and filled out a submission form for [Mr. DNA](https://www.mrdnalab.com/).
