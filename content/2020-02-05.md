To do:

* ~~Edit and submit today's *Refuge Notebook*.~~
* Sandpiper Lake *Elodea* EA.

I worked some on the *Elodea* Environmental Assessment. 

I attended the monthly Alaska Invasive Species Partnership teleconference at 09:00 to talk about earthworms.

I attended a meeting about preparing for morel hunters in the Swan Lake Fire this spring.

I edited and submitted this week's *Refuge Notebook* article.

I took a short walk on the Keen Eye Trail to collect spruce cones. I found some under a singe tree at 60.46457 °N, 151.07216 °W.

In one cone there was an orange (Diptera?) larva in the stem in a white, silken cocoon. This I photographed (frames 659–665) and collected (LifeScanner vial BOLD-268).

In another cone I found smaller, silken cocoons containing orange immatures (Diptera?). The first I photographed (frames 666–670) and collected into vial BOLD-8W0.

In the same cone I photographed another cocoon (frames 671–676) and collected it into vial BOLD-QH4.

Also from the same cone I photographed another cocoon (frames 677–681) and collected it into vial BOLD-BS8.

In most of the cones I examined I found no insects.
