To do:

* Submit this week's *Refuge Notebook* article.
* *Refuge Notebook* catch-up.
* Early adopter data management homework.
* Blackfish diet analysis.
* Sandpiper Lake *Elodea* project PUPs.

I finished processing snowshoe hare data that I had started yesterday.

That updated run on mBRAVE that I initiated yesterday never got anywhere. It gives the message, "Please Wait: Initial Processing of This Run is Underway." This is how it has looked since the middle of the day yesterday. I think there must be a problem with the run parameters.
