To do:

* ~~Submit this week's *Refuge Notebook* article.~~
* *Refuge Notebook* catch-up.
* Early adopter data management homework.
* Blackfish diet analysis.
* ~~Sandpiper Lake *Elodea* project PUPs~~.

I finished processing snowshoe hare data that I had started yesterday.

That updated run on mBRAVE that I initiated yesterday never got anywhere. It gives the message, "Please Wait: Initial Processing of This Run is Underway." This is how it has looked since the middle of the day yesterday. I think there must be a problem with the run parameters.

I received and worked on formatting this week's *Refuge Notebook* article, getting it submitted to the *[Clarion](https://www.peninsulaclarion.com/)*. I worked some on formatting older articles, but the connection to the CMS was so slow that I could not get this work posted.

I started working on the PUPs for herbicides to be used in *Elodea* eradication work, spending most of the afternoon on PUPs.

We had a biology staff meeting via conference call this afternoon. We are going to be teleworking for a while.
