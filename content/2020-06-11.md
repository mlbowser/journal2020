Jake and I worked on the checklist some today, fixing records for which origin was lacking. I also worked on improving the formatting of the checklist.

I worked some on the Sandpiper Lake elodea eradication project aviation safety plan.

I stopped by the office in the evening to get my field gear together for field work tomorrow. I also walked quickly down to Headquarters Lake. There does not appear to be a caterpillar outbreak going on in these woods. There were some geometrid caterpillars, but I saw no noctuids. The mosquitoes were nasty. I enjoyed just seeing some of these woods again.
