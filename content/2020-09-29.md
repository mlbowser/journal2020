I entered taxon names and classifications into Arctos for names in Hilliard and Asmund [-@hilliard_studies_1963] that were not in Arctos. I loaded these records.

I started work on a *Refuge Notebook* article on duckweeds.

I learned that specimens of *Lemna minor* from our area are likely *Lemna turionifera* based on known distributions. *Lemna turionifera* is the more cold-hardy of the two species [@landolt_morphological_1975]. These two species are well separated based on DNA sequences [@bog_genetic_2010; @wang_dna_2010].
