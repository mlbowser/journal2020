To do:

* Contact DEC about pesticide applicator license.
* Finish Sandpiper Lake PASP.

I worked on obtaining emergency contacts for the Sandpiper Lake Project Aviation Safety Plan.

I tried multiple ways of contacting AK DEC to see about getting my pesticide applicator license renewed.

I worked on entering specimen data into Arctos for which data were loss in the Arctos data loss event this spring.
