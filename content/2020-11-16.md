I posted entries for Mullet and Morton [-@mullet_snowmobile_2021] in our [publications bibliography](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Kenai/what_we_do/science/bibliography.html) and [Biology News](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Kenai/what_we_do/science/biology-news.html).

I edited this week's *Refuge Notebook* article.

I started the CMS training, watching [Part 1 - Introduction to the Drupal Content Management System](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/63bd6de4-7003-4da6-8bd5-45463e7454e1) and [Part 2 - Editing Content](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/8c36ebf9-f826-478e-9585-f260c2111c58).
