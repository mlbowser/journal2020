## Thursday, October 1

To do:

* ~~Review article for John.~~
* ~~Identify duckweed from Daniels Lake outlet stream.~~
* Collect duckweed from golf course?
* Post hare data.

I walked down to Headquarters Lake wetland and set out a yellow pan trap at Slikok project site MG12. On the way back I found a large, pale yellow slug (iNaturalist: [61408726](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/61408726)). It is a *Prophysaon*, maybe *Prophysaon foliolatum*. I took a tissue sample from the tail (BOLD-3NWKVDLF5). I added this to the collection ([KNWR:Inv:56](https://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Inv:56)).

I did examine the *Lemna* specimens that I collected from the outlet stream of Daniels Lake on [Monday](#monday-september-28). They mostly were not forming rootless turions, though I did find a couple of what I think were turions. I was eventually able to see the dorsal rows of papillae, making these *Lemna turionifera*. It was only evident on the younger fronds. More disturbing, I did not find any turions that completely lacked any vestige of roots. This might have been because I have been keeping them at room temperature on the windo sill since [Monday](#monday-september-28).

I examined *Lemna* specimens I had collected from an unnamed lake off of Swan Lake Road on [September 18](#friday-september-18) (iNaturalist: [60331267](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60331267)), which I had just thrown into the freezer at the end of the day. I was able to find a central row of dorsal papillae on these, also, so they are *Lemna turionifera*. Strangely, I saw no turions, which I expected at this time of year. I found some *Spirodela polyrhiza* (iNaturalist: [61429235](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/61429235)) and *Lemna trisulca* (iNaturalist: [60331531](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60331531)) mixed in with this sample.
