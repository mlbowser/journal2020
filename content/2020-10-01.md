## Thursday, October 1

To do:

* ~~Review article for John.~~
* Identify duckweed from Daniels Lake outlet stream
* Collect duckweed from golf course?
* Post hare data.

I walked down to Headquarters Lake wetland and set out a yellow pan trap at Slikok project site MG12. On the way back I found a large, pale yellow slug (iNaturalist: [61408726](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/61408726)). It is a *Prophysaon*, maybe *Prophysaon foliolatum*. I took a tissue sample from the tail (BOLD-3NWKVDLF5). I added this to the collection ([KNWR:Inv:56](https://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Inv:56)).
