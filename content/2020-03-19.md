To do:

* *Refuge Notebook* catch-up.
* Early adopter data management homework.
* Blackfish diet analysis.

I received an e-mail from Todd Steinlage regarding the Sandpiper Lake *Elodea* sample. Based on a qPCR test and an ITS sequence, this one appears to be *Elodea canadensis* (specimen record: [KNWR:Herb:12443](http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Herb:12443)). This is consistent with our guess that this population was started by a floatplane bringing it from Anchorage because Anchorage populations were identified as *Elodea canadensis* [@morton_responding_2019].

I entered data for the five *Dallia pectoralis* specimens from which Apphia and I had dissected out gut contents ([KNWRObs:Fish:12](http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWRObs:Fish:12)â€“[KNWRObs:Fish:16](http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWRObs:Fish:16)). Now I would like to set up the SCVUC pipeline on Yeti for analyzing the blackfish gut contents.
