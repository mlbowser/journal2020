To do:

* Blackfish analysis.

I worked on uploading images to the blackfish records on Arctos.

I uploaded pecimen data downloaded from Arctos and DNA extraction methods, DNA sequencing methods, resulting raw metagenomic data, and related files from RTL Genomics to Zenodo [@bowser_raw_2020].

I attended the biology check-in telecon at 11:00.

I wrote the introduction and methods sections for the blackfish diet article.
