To do:

* Blackfish analysis.
* Publish blackfish sequence data.
* Format Derek's black spruce article.
* Early adopters' homework.

I worked on uploading images to the blackfish records on Arctos.

I uploaded pecimen data downloaded from Arctos and DNA extraction methods, DNA sequencing methods, resulting raw metagenomic data, and related files from RTL Genomics to Zenodo [@bowser_raw_2020].
