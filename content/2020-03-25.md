To do:

* ~~Format and this week's *Refuge Notebook* article to the *Clarion*.~~
* *Refuge Notebook* catch-up.
* Finish blackfish diet analysis.
* Publish blackfish diet raw data.
* Finish metadata for data management team meeting tomorrow.

I edited this week's *Refuge Notebook* article.

I worked on identifications from the blackfish diet analysis, getting the first round of IDs done. BOLD's ID Engine apparently went down, though, so I could not finish re-examining the rotifer sequences.

I attended the biology telecon at 11:00.

I finished editing this week's *Refuge Notebook* article and submitted it to the paper.
