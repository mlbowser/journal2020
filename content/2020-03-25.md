To do:

* Format and this week's *Refuge Notebook* article to the *Clarion*.
* *Refuge Notebook* catch-up.
* Finish blackfish diet analysis.
* Publish blackfish diet raw data.

I edited this week's *Refuge Notebook* article.

I worked on identifications from the blackfish diet analysis, getting the first round of IDs done. BOLD's ID Engine apparently went down, though, so I could not finish re-examining the rotifer sequences.
