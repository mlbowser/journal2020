Today I drove in to the office.

Pulling specimens from bulk sample [KNWR:Ento:7159](https://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:7159). These were insects from yellow pan traps at Emerald Lake, 30 June to 1 July 2011 to test whether or not we can get good sequences from these specimens stored in ethanal in a freezer since 2011. From this sample I pulled a delphacid (BOLD-3NI8V5KR9), a nematode (BOLD-3NM7B6XI1), and a muscoid fly (BOLD-3NLY2S1E7). I prepared a shipment of 49 LifeScanner specimens to go out (USPS tracking number: LZ992622666US).

I looked in the lab drains for *Badonnelia*, but I found only what looked like *Entomobrya*.

I edited a draft of next week's *Refuge Notebook* article.

While on a walk on Kasilof Beach in the late afternoon I picked up one Rock Sandpiper dropping (iNaturalist: [65249534](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/65249534)).
