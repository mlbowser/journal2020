To do:

* Intra-Service Section 7 Biological Evaluation Form

I worked on the Intra-Service Section 7 Biological Evaluation Form for the Sandpiper Lake project. I downloaded occurrences from Sandpiper Lake [@gbiforg_gbif_2020-7_Sandpiper].

### Biology staff meeting at 11:00

I happened to notice that the locations seem to be wrong on specimens [KNWR:Herb:1480](http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Herb:1480)-[KNWR:Herb:1482](http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Herb:1482). I need to check the labels on these specimens.

### Reed canary grass meeting at 11:30

Getting a species list from Sandpiper Lake.

```r
sp1 <- read.delim("0056501-200221144449610/0056501-200221144449610.csv")

plot(sp1$decimalLongitude, sp1$decimalLatitude)

su1 <- unique(sp1[,c("kingdom", "phylum", "class", "order", "family", "genus", "species", "scientificName")])

write.csv(su1, "2020-05-05-1337_Sandpiper_Lake_species.csv", row.names=FALSE)
```
I finished the Intra-Service Section 7 Biological Evaluation Form for the Sandpiper Lake elodea eradication project and sent it off.
