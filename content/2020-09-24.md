I pulled the pan trap I had set out yesterday. From it I collected four small Hymenoptera into LifeScanner vials (BOLD-3NLKTM4P1, BOLD-3NLDE2YK4, BOLD-3NLC2UG63, BOLD-3NLFGK474)

Colin and I drove out to Swan Lake Road and walked down Sucker Creek looking for reed canarygrass from the culvert to 60.72942, -150.66392. We found none. There were many silver salmon spawning in the stream, which was neat to see.

At Sucker Creek not far from the road I had set out a yellow pan trap on the way out. I checked it on the way back. It had yielded only two insects: a tipulid (BOLD-3NWVUOF85) and a cicadellid (BOLD-3NX2VOSB7).

Back at the office I entered data from LifeScanner specimens.	

Extracting coordinates from an image:
