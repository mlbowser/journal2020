Allie and I drove out to the Marsh Lake dozer line to help with finding the Marsh Lake Trail where the recent dozer line crosses it. We ended up just discussing this the State Forestry folks and leaving them a GPS loaded with the Marsh Lake Trail as a track. We decided that it would be ok to rerout the Marsh Lake Trail for the short distance where the original trail was hard to find, aligning it with the current dozer line for that section.
