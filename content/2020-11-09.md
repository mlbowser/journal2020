I looked through some more LifeScanner identification results.

Aphids observed on [June 12](#friday-june-12) (iNaturalist: [50057105](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/50057105)) on *Salix bebbiana* are *Aphis farinosa*. I added this species to the Refuge's checklist.

A larva observed on [June 12](#friday-june-12) (iNaturalist: [50823985](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/50823985)) was identified *Acilius semisulcatus*. This species had been on the Refuge's checklist, but it had lacked evidence.

A sequence from a minute wasp (iNaturalist: [50806246](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/50806246)) was 98% similar to a sequence of a pteromalid on BOLD (BIN [BOLD:ACM1005](http://boldsystems.org/index.php/Public_BarcodeCluster?clusteruri=BOLD:ACM1005)).

A snail from Vogel Lake (iNaturalist: [56859573](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/56859573)) is genus *Gyraulus*. Its sequence is closest to sequences of specimens from Russia and Mongolia. These are labeled on BOLD and GenBank as *Gyraulus* sp. 17106 or *Gyraulus* sp. clade B TS-2018. These are in BIN [BOLD:ACQ2739](http://boldsystems.org/index.php/Public_BarcodeCluster?clusteruri=BOLD:ACQ2739).

The GenBank sequence labeled as *Gyraulus* sp. 17106 is GenBank accession [KC495834](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/KC495834). This specimen came from Russia, Irkutsk Oblast, Angara (maybe the Angara River?). Identified as haplotype H91 by von Oheimb et al. [-@von_Oheimb_et_al_2013], they did not assign this haplotype to a clade.

*Gyraulus* sp. clade B TS-2018 is clade B from Saito et al. [-@saito_phylogeography_2018], an entity with a distribution of the Palearctic and the Japanese Archipelago.

A leech from Vogel Lake (iNaturalist: [56860767](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/56860767)) is Haemopidae, but there is no close match on BOLD or GenBank. The closest is *Haemopis sanguisuga* at 90.62% similarity.

A diving beetle from Vogel Lake (iNaturliast: [56861129](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/56861129)) was identified as *Ilybius quadrimaculatus*. I added this species to the Refuge's checklist.

A Lepidoptera larva I had collected from leaf litter off of Skilak Lake Road on [July 7](#tuesday-july-7) (iNaturalist: [52380873](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/52380873)) was *Sunira verberata*.

A fly from [September 2](#wednesday-september-2) (iNaturalist: [59732100](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/59732100)) is *Phasia robertsonii* or *Phasia aeneoventris*. The two species appear to be indistinguishable based on COI DNA barcodes. Day [-@Day1995] considered *Phasia aeneoventris* to be synonymous with *Phasia robertsonii*. Sun and Marshall [-@sun_systematics_2003] considered these to be distinct species, with *P. robertsonii* in the eastern Nearctic and *Phasia aeneoventris* in the western Nearctic. They were also separated morphologically by the shape of the ventrolateral process of the distiphallus. Most other specimens from our region have been identified as *Phasia aeneoventris*. Specimens [KNWR:Ento:7439](https://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:7439) from the City of Kenai I had originally identified as *Phasia aeneoventris* ? in 2011 [@bowser_lab_2012]. A molecular observation record from the Slikok project [UAMObs:Ento:240173](https://arctos.database.museum/guid/UAMObs:Ento:240173) I had identified as *Phasia robertsonii*. It does match some sequences identified as *P. robertsonii*, but now I do not think I can say that it is *P. robertsonii* because there is really no clear separation between these species based on COI DNA barcode sequences. I updated the identification of this species to *Phasia aeneoventris* ? with the following identification remarks.

> It appears that Phasia robertsonii and Phasia aeneoventris cannot be distinguished based on COI DNA barcode sequences, but of these two species P. aeneoventris is the only one known from this area.

I removed *Phasia robertsonii* from the Refuge's species list and added *Phasia aeneoventris*.

I updated the identification of the iNaturalist record above, including similar remarks.
