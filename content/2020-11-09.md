I looked through some more LifeScanner identification results.

Aphids observed on [June 12](#friday-june-12) (iNaturalist: [50057105](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/50057105)) on *Salix bebbiana* are *Aphis farinosa*. I added this species to the Refuge's checklist.

A larva observed on [June 12](#friday-june-12) (iNaturalist: [50823985](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/50823985)) was identified *Acilius semisulcatus*. This species had been on the Refuge's checklist, but it had lacked evidence.

A sequence from a minute wasp (iNaturalist: [50806246](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/50806246)) was 98% similar to a sequence of a pteromalid on BOLD (BIN [BOLD:ACM1005](http://boldsystems.org/index.php/Public_BarcodeCluster?clusteruri=BOLD:ACM1005)).

A snail from Vogel Lake (iNaturalist: [56859573](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/56859573)) is genus *Gyraulus*. Its sequence is closest to sequences of specimens from Russia and Mongolia. These are labeled on BOLD and GenBank as *Gyraulus* sp. 17106 or *Gyraulus* sp. clade B TS-2018. These are in BIN [BOLD:ACQ2739](http://boldsystems.org/index.php/Public_BarcodeCluster?clusteruri=BOLD:ACQ2739).

The GenBank sequence labeled as *Gyraulus* sp. 17106 is GenBank accession [KC495834](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/KC495834). This specimen came from Russia, Irkutsk Oblast, Angara (maybe the Angara River?). Identified as haplotype H91 by von Oheimb et al. [-@von_Oheimb_et_al_2013], they did not assign this haplotype to a clade.
