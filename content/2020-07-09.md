I met Ed and Sarah at Hakala plot HAK5, which had burned in the Swan Lake Fire. There were too many downed trees for us to safely work here, so we proceeded to HAK6.

Dawn joined us at HAK6. This was a beautiful, lush site under birches and *Alnus incana*.

The alders were extensively damaged by green sawfly larvae that must be <i>Monsoma pulveratum</i> (iNaturalist: [52964721](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/52964721)).
