To do:

* ~~Finish sorting Berlese samples.~~
* ~~Get other Berlese samples and LifeScanner samples from work.~~
* Compile data from sweep and Berlese samples.
* Slikok occupancy?
* Edit this week's *Refuge Notebook* article.
* Proposals for 2019 to Mark?
* Contract for fluridone.
* Review Rob's pike treatment plan.

This mornig I sorted a Berlese sample from site MG39, soil sample 1, barcode UAM100185965.

identification|count
:---|---:
Thysanoptera|6
Araneae|6
Coleoptera|4
Arachnida|341
Collembola|23
Insecta|2

Arctos is still down, so I still cannot enter data for these samples. I assigned catalog numbers manually.

barcode|GUID

I worked on preparing documents for a contract for acquiring pelleted fluridone.

I started to edits this week's Refuge Notebook article.

I did some reading, evaluating whether or not we should start doing metagenomic work in house with a minION sequencer.

In the evening I drove to the Refuge, where I picked up the rest of the Berlese samples to ship out to RTL Genomics.

While there, I also attempted to collect some *Badonnelia* from the floor drains. I did collect several minute arthropods, at least one of which was a pale psocid. There were a number of springtails, also.
