To do:

* Fill out a USFWS Alaska Region 2020 field project go/no go screening matrix and individual project safety plan for the Swan Lake Fire burn severity and vegetation response project. 
* ~~Submit this week's *Refuge Notebook* article.~~
* *Refuge Notebook* catch-up.
* Revise aquatic herbicide PUPs.
* Improve Kenai NWR checklist processing/formatting.
* Slikok occupancy.
* Finish 2019 black spruce project.

I made final edits on this week's *Refuge Notebook* article and got it sent in.

I worked on adding origin values for species in the checklist for which this value was missing, starting at the bottom of the list with species starting with Z, but then FWSpecies' editing interface apparently went down when I was trying to edit *Stereocaulon alpinum*.

In the afternoon I drove in to the office, then to the Snowshoe Gun Club for bear firearms training, where I qualified.

I received some of the caterpillars collected from the Marsh Lake Trail.
