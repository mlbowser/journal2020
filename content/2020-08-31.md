To do:

* ~~Finish *Refuge Notebook* article.~~
* Prepare fungi specimens for DNA sequencing submission.

I finished the *Refuge Notebook* article on Kenai birch.

I got together the data, notes, etc. from the whole genome sequencing data from birches that we had done last fall and started a data uploat to Zenodo.

Jake stopped by and returned the camera from his trip with Mark out to Sandpiper Lake on Friday, August 28. The *Elodea* that had been treated with diquat was now yellowing and brittle.
