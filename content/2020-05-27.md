I drove in and worked at the office this morning just to check in.

I got a list of non-native plant species to Amanda.

Steve Miller gave me two specimens of morels he had collected (iNaturalist observation IDs: [47524671](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/47524671) and [47524963](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/47524963)).

I worked on the *Refuge Notebook* article due today.

I added *Morchella tomentosa* to the Refuge's checklist.
