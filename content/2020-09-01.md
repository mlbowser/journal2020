I packaged fluridone water samples from Sandpiper Lake and drove them to FedEx Kenai to go out today (FedEx tracking #: 396397274746).

I re-entered data for the earthworm specimens sent to me by Tyler ([KNWR:Inv:47](http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Inv:47)â€“[KNWR:Inv:52](http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Inv:52)), this time using Arctos' bulkloader so that I will not lose my work. I photographed these specimens, cut tissue samples from their posterior ends, and placed tissue in LifeScanner vials, and worked on entering data into Arctos and [lifescanner.net](http://lifescanner.net).
