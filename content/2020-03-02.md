I sorted Berlese sample [KNWR:Ento:11377](http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11377).

I uploaded citations for Jakubas and Firman [-@jakubas_sandpiper_1984]. When I looked at the map I saw a couple of missing records, so I added these ([KNWRObs:Herb:952](http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWRObs:Herb:952)â€“[KNWRObs:Herb:953](http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWRObs:Herb:953)).

I started work on this week's *Refuge Notebook* article.

I participated in the planning meeting for burn severity mapping and invasive species work for the Swan Lake Fire burn area.

```r
## How many species were documented at site MG28?
## Downloaded analysis dataset.
wd <- "C:/Users/mattbowser/Documents/Refuge_Notebook/2020/submissions/2020-03-06_Refuge_Notebook"
setwd(wd)

d1 <- read.csv("oo_371428.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

sl <- grepl("site MG28", d1$SPEC_LOCALITY)
d1[sl,]
levels(as.factor(d1$SPECIES[sl]))
## 80 species or BIN resolution identifications were obtained at this site.
