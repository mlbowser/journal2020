## Thursday, September 3

I think the *Amaranthus* from [yesterday](#wednesday-september-2) is *Amaranthus retroflexus* because the appearance looks right and there are two previous Alaskan records ([UAM:Herb:16434](https://arctos.database.museum/guid/UAM:Herb:16434), [UAM:Herb:46957](https://arctos.database.museum/guid/UAM:Herb:46957)). There are also five records on AKEPIC.

I prepared 29 LifeScanner specimens to go out (USPS tracking #: LZ991546597US, Arctos container KNWRC4610). [Some vials](#lifescanner-vials-with-missing-data) were missing data, which I will need to track down and send next time.

In preparation for sequencing of fungal specimens I started an iNaturalist project (<https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/2020-kenai-peninsula-fungal-sequencing>) and exported the [data](#data-for-fungal-specimens-to-be-sequenced). I took tissue samples from the 20 specimens, using lighter to sterilize the forceps between each specimen.

Over lunch I tried looking for an ITS sequence in one of our birch genomes. I tried VSEARCH:

Slurm script:

```

Output:

```sh

So apparently VSEARCH does not search against these long contigs.
