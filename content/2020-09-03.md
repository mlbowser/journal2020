I prepared 29 LifeScanner specimens to go out (USPS tracking #: LZ991546597US, Arctos container KNWRC4610). [Some vials](#lifescanner-vials-with-missing-data) were missing data, which I will need to track down and send next time.

In preparation for sequencing of fungal specimens I started an iNaturalist project (<https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/2020-kenai-peninsula-fungal-sequencing>).
