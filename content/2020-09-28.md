I stopped by Arc Lake this morning looking for *Spirodela*. I saw none there.

I started entering algal records from Gene Lake in Hilliard and Asmund [-@hilliard_studies_1963].

Later today I drove out to Suneva Lake to check for *Spirodela*. I had found it here some time ago and there was a question as to whether or not it could persist here. I did find *Spirodela* at the same spot (iNaturalist: [61162370](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/61162370)).

I stopped at the outlet of Bishop Creek and saw no *Spirodela* there.

At the Stormy Lake boat launch and at the lakeâ€™s outlet I saw no *Spirodela* despite the wind coming from the south. I did see reed canarygrass at the boat launch, which I documented using Survey123.

At the culvert of the outlet stream of Daniels Lake at Loon Court I collected some *Lemna minor* (iNaturalist: [61162513](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/61162513)). I saw no *Spirodela* here.

I stopped at the outlet of Lower Salamatof Lake on the way back. I saw no duck weeds there.

I had set out a yellow pan trap under my office window earlier in the day. It yielded many insects, but I ran out of time, so I only collected one, a minute was (BOLD-3NWK5YG21).
