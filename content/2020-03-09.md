I attended the Board of Fisheries meeting, today the committee of the whole.

While sitting through discussions of other proposals, I revisited examining sequences from the *Aporrectodea* specimens from Pilgrim Hot Springs. These are *Aporrectodea longa* or *Aporrectodea trapezoides*. 

Our sequences agreed with sequences from BOLD BIN [BOLD:AAA6243](http://boldsystems.org/index.php/Public_BarcodeCluster?clusteruri=BOLD:AAA6243), which is mostly *Aporrectodea trapezoides* (100% to 99.83% similarity to multiple sequences). There are three sequences of *Aporrectodea longa* in this BIN. All three of these were collected from Ontario and identified by Benoit Richard.

The *Aporrectodea longa* sequences from Porco et al. [-@porco_reference_2018] are in BIN [BOLD:AAA2181](http://boldsystems.org/index.php/Public_BarcodeCluster?clusteruri=BOLD:AAA2181).

Our Pilgrim Hot springs sequences aligned with sequences on BOLD from lineage *Aporrectodea trapezoides* L2 of Martinsson et al. [-@martinsson_dna-barcoding_2015] that are on BOLD. Their *Aporrectodea trapezoides* L1 lineage is in BOLD BIN [BOLD:AAC5530](http://boldsystems.org/index.php/Public_BarcodeCluster?clusteruri=BOLD:AAC5530).

Ok, our second Pilgrim Hot Springs samples is 100% similar to *Aporrectodea trapezoides* lineage II, clade H, clone 1 *sensu* Fern√°ndez et al. [-@fernandez_vagrant_2011]. This is the widespread, peregrine clone.

The meeting ended early at around 15:00, so I checked out of the hotel and drove home.
