To do:

* Sandpiper Lake snowmachine decision/logistics.
* Pesticide applicator training.
* Board of Fish meeting travel arrangements.

I sorted Berlese sample [KNWR:Ento:11369](http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11369).

Contents:

identification|count
:---|---:
Arachnida|114
Insecta|3
Formicinae|11
Animalia|1
*Cixius*|1
Sciaroidea|1
Arthropoda|2
Thysanoptera|1
Collembola|1

In this sample was something pale and difficult to identify, labeled as Animalia in the table above. It might have been a contracted tardigrade, a flatworm, plant material, or something else. There were also a couple of pale, elongate arthropods that might have been Collembola.
