I worked on entering specimen data into Arctos for which data were loss in the Arctos data loss event this spring.

I created records for [KNWR:Inv:54](https://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Inv:54) and [KNWR:Ento:11385](https://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11385)-[KNWR:Ento:11390](https://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11390).

[KNWR:Ento:11389](https://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11389) was problematic. I had written on [April 17](#friday-april-17) when I sorted this one that this was from site MG12, soil sample 1 (barcode: UAM100185964), but we did not visit site MG 12 in 2019.

That left two uncertain associations. These were Long Term Ecological Monitoring Program site 3074, soil sample 2  and Slikok watershed project site MG24, soil sample 1. [KNWR:Ento:11389](https://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11389) must have been from MG24, soil sample 1, so this is how I assigned it. 

[KNWR:Ento:11385](https://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11385) must have been from Long Term Ecological Monitoring Program site 3074, soil sample 2.

I made small edits on the Sandpiper Lake PASP.

I need to make Arctos records for the fungal and bacterial soil sample vials.

I started entering data for these samples.
