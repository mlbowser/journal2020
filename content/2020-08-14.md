Vogel Lake cabin and our tents. We did not all stay in the cabin due to COVID-19 concerns.

Colin, Jake, and I took the canoes back to Sandpiper Lake in the morning. Colin and I applied the Littora diquat over the areas where elodea was present, treating 2.5 acres in all with 5 gallons of Littora.

The bigger task for the day was getting all of our remaining equipment back to Vogel Lake cabin for pick-up. We loaded all of the equipment and the unused Littora into the Alumacraft and canoes, which we had to drag much of the way through the little streams and around the pike barriers. We cleaned and inspected our boat and equipment to make sure that we brought neither *Elodea* nor residual herbicide through the other lakes.

Later Shay took us and all of our equipment to Headquarters Lake in three loads in the 185.
