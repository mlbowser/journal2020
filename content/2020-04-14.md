I sorted a Berlese soil sample from site 3069, soil sample 1. Vial barcode: UAM100185963.

Contents:

identification|count
:---|---:
Arachnida|255
Araneae|2
Collembola|13
Thysanoptera|5
Hymenoptera|1
Hemiptera|2

As has been typical in these samples, there were really more springtails and mites that were added in clumps at the end.
