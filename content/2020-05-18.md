To do:

* Finish *AKES Newsletter*.
* First aid / CPR training.
* Improve Kenai NWR checklist processing/formatting.
* ~~Enter data for *Rabdophaga* specimens.~~
* Slikok occupancy.
* Finish 2019 black spruce project.
* Clean up stuff on Yeti.

I added *Geopyxis carbonaria* to the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge's checklist based on iNaturalist observation [46393003](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/46393003).

I have been corresponding quite a bit regarding grasses to be used for revegation along a power line right of way.

I entered data from a couple of recent LifeScanner specimens into lifescanner.net.

I collected a rosette gall on *Salix fuscescens* (2020-05-18_MLB01, iNatualist: [46407797](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/46407797)) and dissected it. Inside the gall were a hymenopteran larva and an egg on the outside of the larva. I attempted to collect the egg, but I dropped it and could not find it. The larva I placed in LifeScanner vial BOLD-JO2.

Hymenoptera larva and egg inside rosette gall on *Salix fuscescens* (2020-05-18_MLB01, iNatualist: [46407797](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/46407797))

A second rosette gall on *Salix fuscescens* (2020-05-18_MLB02, iNatualist: [46413661](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/46413661)), had a minute larva next to an old Lepidoptera head and thorax. This was among the outer leaves of the rosette. I collected this larva and placed it into vial BOLD-I87. In the middle of the rosette was a hymenopteran larva, which I did not retain.

I collected two more rosette galls. One contained a hymenopteran larva and the other was empty.

As I am collecting more I should put results into a table.

contents|count
:---|---:
Hymenoptera larva|3
Hymenoptera pupa|3
Hymenoptera larva and egg|1
empty|3
2 Hymenoptera larvae, one large and one small|1

One of these included a Hymenoptera larva and what might be a hyperparasitoid (2020-05-18_MLB03, iNaturalist: [46433634](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/46433634)). The smaller larva that might be a hyperparasitoid I put into LifeScanner vial BOLD-G57. The larger larva I put into LifeScanner vial BOLD-UJ8.

I might be too late. This is frustrating because the first gall on *Salix barclayi* that I looked at still had a *Rabdophaga* larva in it.
