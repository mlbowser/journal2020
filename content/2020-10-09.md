I spent some time trying to figure out the best test for comparing the paired proportions of spruce samples from our 2015 grassland work.

I examined a series of worm specimens from Fairbanks. Clitellum on segments 26-31, tubercula pubertatis on segments 29-30. This is *Bimastos rubidus*.

I collected two wasps (BOLD-3NUO7C461 and BOLD-3NMISCHX9) and one fly (BOLD-3NUD6WCE4) from a yellow pan trap left out for a short time under a cottonwood.

I entered snowshoe hare data from 2003 to 2000.
