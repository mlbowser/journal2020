
## Thursday, August 6

I am trying to identify a *Rorippa* that I collected from the power line off of Fuller Lakes Trail on [August 4](#tuesday-august-4) (iNaturalist: [55618332](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/55618332)).

Keying using the key to *Rorippa* in the efloras Flora of North America treatment (<http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon_id=128745>).

1 -> 2 -> 4 -> *Rorippa barbareifolia*. The fruits are consistently 4 valved.

The *Polygonum* I collected from the same area on August 4 looks like *Polygonum aviculare*.

A grass I collected on August 4 is *Lolium multiflorum* (iNaturalist: [55627973](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/55627973)).

I worked on bulkloading Hakala plot 5.64 m radius plot vegetation data into Arctos.
