To do:

* *Refuge Notebook* catch-up.
* JHAs
* pesticide applicator training.

I have the following JHAs to complete.

* pesticide application
* field data collection

I worked on formatting Liz's article for the AKES Newsletter.

I helped make some face masks.

I worked some on the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge checklist.

### Early adopters' data management meeting at 13:00

* No new homework this time?
* Could add spatial extent.
* Next big step will be to actually archive the dataset.

In the afternoon, Apphia and I walked down to Coal Creek where it crosses under Kalifornsky Beach Road. Where there was a little open water we collected two caddisflies (BOLD-UB0 and BOLD-7L9) and one worm (BOLD-OC2).
