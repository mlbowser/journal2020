To do

* Submit this week's *Refuge Notebook* article.
* Slikok occupancy manuscript/analysis.
* New CMS training.
* FY20 Summary Report on Invasive Species Projects

I worked on the Slikok occupancy manuscript some. I decided to change the formatting to the [Journal of the Entomological Society of British Columbia](https://journal.entsocbc.ca/index.php/journal/index).
