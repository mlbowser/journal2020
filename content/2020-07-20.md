Mark and I drove out to plot HAK5, the last Hakala plot to be surveyed. This was a burned plot within the Swan Lake Fire. It had burned pretty severely, but some aspens were resprouting. Sparse birch and black spruce seedlings were also present. I had difficulty identifying an immature plant that I think is *Chamerion latifolium*. Lisa and Hunter joined us here and did a CBI plot. I did the 5.64 m radius plant survey and I took a soil sample of the top 10 cm of soil for soil fungal DNA extraction. These were at 15 m east and west of plot center corresponding to flagging for t he CBI plot.

Hakala plot HAK5.

There were morels here, two of which I collected. I had dug the soil pit for the western sample before I realized that there was a morel immediately beside the soil pit. I hope that morel DNA is picked up in the soil sample.

After that I stopped by plot HAK4 and did the same LTEMP veg protocol and soil samples. I saw no resprouting plants here. I saw what looked like immature *Chamerion latifolium* here as well.
