I received sequences from LifeScanner and from the 2019 black spruce sweep net samples. I started downloading the sequence data from RTL Genomics.


Two worm specimens collected by Adrian and Tyler from Pilgrim Hot Springs are either *Aporrectodea longa* or *Aporrectodea trapezoides*. Both specimens closely matched multiple sequences identified as both of these species, so this was a little confusing.

I also received a notification on the Slikok project manuscript. It is currently being edited.
