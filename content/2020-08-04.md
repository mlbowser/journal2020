I received the Berlese sample data from RTL Genomics this morning. I perused these quickly. What I saw looked good.

Annaleese and I first drove to the Marsh Lake Trail trailhead, where we looked for *Bromus tectorum*, which had been reported from this site. There were many grasses here, but we failed to find *B. tectorum*. *Agrostis scabra* and *Deschampsia cespitosa* were the dominant grasses.

Next we hiked the beginning of the Fuller Lakes Trail surveying for weeds using Survey123. The trail had been used as a fire break during the Swan Lake Fire. On the trail were typical trailside weeds: *Taraxacum officinale*, *Poa annua*, *Plantago major*, and *Phleum pratense*.

We walked as far as the power lines, then we crossed the creek, following the power lines west from the Fuller Lakes Trail. The power lines were quite weedy.
