I finished revising and submitted my *Refuge Notebook* article on morels this morning.

I mapped FIA points within the Swan Lake fire and near roads for Lisa.

Map of FIA points that are within the Swan Lake Fire perimeter and that are within 1 mile from roads.

For extracting non-native plant data I obtained the extent of the Swan Lake Fire perimeter in WGS84 coordinates:

I downloaded data from GBIF [@gbiforg_gbif_2020-8_Swan_Lake_Fire_plants] and from iNaturalist.org (<https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?nelat=60.728891&nelng=-149.854865&place_id=any&swlat=60.430024&swlng=-150.529237&taxon_id=47126>), extracted records within the fire perimeter, dropped the iNaturalist records from the GBIF dataset, and send these data to Justin.
