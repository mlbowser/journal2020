To do:

* ~~Submit this week's *Refuge Notebook* article.~~
* Revise aquatic herbicide PUPs.
* ~~Get non-native plant data to AKNHP folks.~~
* ~~Get burn severity plot data to Lisa.~~
* Improve Kenai NWR checklist processing/formatting.
* Slikok occupancy.
* Finish 2019 black spruce project.
* Clean up stuff on Yeti.

I finished revising and submitted my *Refuge Notebook* article on morels this morning.

I mapped FIA points within the Swan Lake fire and near roads for Lisa.

Map of FIA points that are within the Swan Lake Fire perimeter and that are within 1 mile from roads.

For extracting non-native plant data I obtained the extent of the Swan Lake Fire perimeter in WGS84 coordinates:

I downloaded data from GBIF [@gbiforg_gbif_2020-8_Swan_Lake_Fire_plants] and from iNaturalist.org (<https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?nelat=60.728891&nelng=-149.854865&place_id=any&swlat=60.430024&swlng=-150.529237&taxon_id=47126>), extracted records within the fire perimeter, dropped the iNaturalist records from the GBIF dataset, and send these data to Justin.

## Now I am working on improving checklist output.

source("make_DWC-A.R")

sl <- dwc1[,3]=="" | 
 dwc1[,4]=="" | 
 dwc1[,5]=="" | 
 dwc1[,6]=="" | 
 dwc1[,7]==""  

## Saving this to manually edit. 
write.csv(dwc1[sl,], "../data/taxonomy_fill-ins.csv", row.names=FALSE)
```
I updated the [make_DWC-A.R](https://github.com/mlbowser/KenaiNWRspecies/blob/master/scripts/make_DwC-A.R) script to incorporate the edited data. The [checklist](https://github.com/mlbowser/KenaiNWRspecies/blob/master/text/checklist.md) now looks much better. It now includes 1,868 species.
