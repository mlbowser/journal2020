I worked on communicating, planning, and getting equipmet together for the Sandpiper Lake elodea application.

Jake and I transferred SonarONE pelleted fluridone, Littora liquid diquat, the outboard motor, the pellet spreader, and the liquid 55 gallon tank to the hangar. We also weighed these items.

Looking at the Alamacraft, it can hold 650 lbs. The liquid tank filled to 50 gallons would be 418 pounds, leaving only 232 pounds, not enough for people and gear. The 24 gallon, tank intended for the ATV would be 200 pounds.

I must make calculations for applying liquid Littora. This should be applied at a maximum of 2 gallons per surface acre. In the past we have applied it at 1 gallon per surface acre.
