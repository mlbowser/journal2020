I worked in the office on cleaning up and catching up.

I did some checking of recent identifications. A *Cerastium* I had seen the other day (iNaturalsit: [52986938](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/52986938)) was *Cerastium fontanum* ssp. *vulgare*.

I looked at what data are available from my 2018 work in the Mystery Hills [@bowser_lab_notebook_2018] and from Paez's work in 1988â€“1989 [@paez_alpine_1991].
