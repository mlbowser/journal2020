To do:

* Fill out a USFWS Alaska Region 2020 field project go/no go screening matrix and individual project safety plan for the Sandpiper Lake elodea eradication project.
* Project aviation safety plan for the Sandpiper Lake elodea eradication project.
* Take A-110 Aviation Transportation of Hazardous Materials course.
* ~~Edit and submit this week's *Refuge Notebook* article.~~
* *Refuge Notebook* catch-up.
* Revise aquatic herbicide PUPs.

I received this week's *Refuge Notebook* article today. I revised this and got it sent to the *Clarion*.

In the evening I entered data for LifeScanner specimens: an immature earthworm from the large island in West Forest Lake (vial BOLD-XH4, iNaturalist: [49066582](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/49066582)) and a tiny caterpillar from a volunteering *Brassica* sp. in our high tunnels (vial BOLD-0S1). I was not able to enter data from a leaf mining Diptera larva in a leaf of bok choy collected this evening (vial BOLD-BS8) because the LifeScanner interface would not accept this vial label.
