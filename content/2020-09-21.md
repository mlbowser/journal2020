To do:

* ~~Take care of notes and data entry from Friday.~~
* Finish snowshoe hare data work.

I searched through paper files, found as many of the snowhshoe hare pellet count data sheets as I could, and scanned these.

At the back door by the lab I collected a fly trapped by spider silk (BOLD-M90).

On the shore of Headquarters Lake I collected a midge from a swarm among *Ledum*.

Some tipulids were apparently just emerging from the lake. These were bouncing about, climbing vegetation frantically, and repeatedly falling, right on the lake shore. Their wings had not yet expanded (BOLD-OJ9).

From deliquescent fungi (I think *Pholiota*) on a birch I collected a larva (BOLD-F59).
