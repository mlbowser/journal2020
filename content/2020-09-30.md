I continued work on my *Refuge Notebook* article on duckweeds.

I found a review of molecular tools for identifying Lemnaceae [@appenroth_telling_2013; @bog_duckweed_2019] and protocols that could be followed [@borisjuk_assessment_2015].

```r
## Converting duckweed productivity to standard units:
## Data from http://www.lrrd.org/lrrd7/1/3.htm

c(2,79) * # metric tonnes/ha yr 
 1/2.47105 * # ha/acre
 2205/1 * # lb./metric tonne
 1/2000 # tons/lb.
[1]  0.8923332 35.2471621
```

I got my *Refuge Notebook* article sent off at the end of the day.
