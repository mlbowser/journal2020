
## Tuesday, March 31

To do:

* ~~Create reciprocal relationship links on Arctos from blackfish records to food items.~~
* ~~Finish reviewing the potential new distribution records.~~

I did finish reviewing potential new distribution records from blackfish gut contents.

### Bio staff telecon at 11:00

* Mark and and I need to work on Job Hazard Analyses.

## Continuing to prepare an Arctos upload.

## Testing one record.
write.csv(rl[1,], "2020-03-31-1405_relationsips_upload_001-001.csv", row.names=FALSE)

## That looked good. Going for the rest.
write.csv(rl[2:137,], "2020-03-31-1405_relationsips_upload_002-137.csv", row.names=FALSE)

## Also need catalog numbers for adding media relationships.
rl$space <- " "
write.csv(rl[,c("new_other_id_number", "space")], "2020-03-31-1432_catnums.csv", row.names=FALSE)

Uploaded the FASTA file to Arctos (http://dx.doi.org/10.7299/X7V1253J).

## Now I want to add colors to the phylogenetic tree.
load("2020-03-30-1345_workspace.RData")

ag2
```
I edited the tree on iTOL, making it prettier, uploaded this to Arctos, and associated it with the occurrence records (<http://arctos.database.museum/media/10608330>).
