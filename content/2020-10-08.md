
## Thursday, October 8

To do:

* FY2020 accomplishments list to Mark
* Canoe Lake to Sucker Creek reed canarygrass map

### Accomplishments list:

* Permitting, planning, and initiation of elodea eradication in Sandpiper Lake.

* Publications, peer-reviewed:

Bowser, M.L., Brassfield, R., Dziergowski, A., Eskelin, T., Hester, J., Magness, D.R., McInnis, M., Melvin, T., Morton, J. M., and Stone, J. 2020. Towards conserving natural diversity: A biotic inventory by observations, specimens, dna barcoding and high-throughput sequencing methods. Biodiversity Data Journal 8: e50124. https://doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.8.e50124.

* Publications, not peer-reviewd:

Bowser, M.L., Burr, S.J., Davis, I., Dubois, G.D., Graham, E.E., Moan, J.E., & Swenson, S. W. (2019). A test of metabarcoding for Early Detection and Rapid Response monitoring for non-native forest pest beetles (Coleoptera). Research Ideas and Outcomes, 5, e48536. https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.5.e48536

Bowser, M.L., Bowser, A.M. 2020. A pilot study examining the diet of introduced Alaska blackfish (Dallia pectoralis T. H. Bean, 1880) in Kenai, Alaska, by metabarcoding.

* Conformed our snowshoe hare monitoring project dataset to regional data management team standards as part of an early adopters data management team.

* Beginning in January 2020, took care of editing and submitting the Refuge's *Refuge Notebook* series.

* Improved the Refuge's species checklist on FWSpecies, adding many species, adding evidence supporting the presence of many species, writing scripts to be eventually used to publish the checklist to GBIF in Darwin Core format, and oversaw Jake's work improving the checklist on FWSpecies.

* Hand sorted 52 mixed arthropod samples (26 sweep net and 26 Berlese) from 2019 black spruce inventory work. These were submitted for metabarcoding and data have been received, but I have not processed the data yet.

* Participated in Composite Burn Index sampling in the Swan Lake Fire burn.

* Conducted non-native plant surveys in the Swan Lake Fire burn and other areas on the Refuge.

* Resurveyed Hakala plots with Ed and Sarah Berg.

I worked on generating maps of the reed canarygrass infestation at Canoe Lake vicinity.

![Map of known reed canarygrass infestations in the vicinity of Canoe Lake. Note that there is more reed canarygrass than what is indicated in the point maps. Along the three streams (Canoe Lake #2 to Canoe Lake #1, Canoe Lake #1 to Sucker Creek, and Sucker Creek from Sucker Lake to the culvert at Swan Lake Road), there are patches of reed canarygrass all along the streams so that the points only indicate the limits of the infestations. Also, Reed canarygrass is dotted along most of the shoreline of Sucker Lake. We just stopped adding points after a time. Canoe Lake #1 is clean except for the inlet and outlet streams.](2020-10-08_Canoe_Lakes_RCG_map.jpg)\
