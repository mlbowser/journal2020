I loaded up the canoe and equipment to go to Canoe Lake today. 

I scanned some more snowshoe hare pellet data sheets.

Ben and I drove out to Canoe Lake, but then we reconsidered that we need further review before applying herbicide in wilderness, so we did not not unload anything.

Since I was already out there, I stopped by Sucker Creek to look for freshwater mussels. Years ago someone told me that he believed that there was another species of mussel in the stream. The stream was quite high today. I saw no mussels.

Here I did collect a caddisfly (vial with human-readable lable BOLD-9O1, QR code BOLD-3NLV2Y9O1) and a small fly (BOLD-8D9, BOLD-3NLWK08D9), a duckweed, and a streamside grass.

### Data management team meeting at 13:15.

* I asked about what to copy over to the regional repository in the "incoming" directory. The answer was that I could copy a snapshot of the whole repository at its current state.

A duckweed I collected at Sucker Creek is *Spirodela polyrhiza* (iNaturalist: [59163202](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/59163202)). This had been observed in 2016 and 2018 in Nikiski (iNaturalist: [16015862](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/16015862), [4123994](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/4123994)).

A specimen identified as *Lemna minor* from Fish Lake ([UAM:Herb:20823](https://arctos.database.museum/guid/UAM:Herb:20823)) appears to have mostly *Spirodela polyrhiza* (L.) Schleid. on it with some *Lemna trisulca* L. There could be Lemna minor L., but I cannot tell from the image. I annotated the specimen record on Arctos.

A grass from Sucker Creek I tentatively identified as *Torreyochloa pallida* (iNaturalist: [59171269](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/59171269)), a species not previously recorded from the Refuge.
