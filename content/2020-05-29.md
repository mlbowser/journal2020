To do:

* Revise aquatic herbicide PUPs.
* Improve Kenai NWR checklist processing/formatting.
* Slikok occupancy.
* Finish 2019 black spruce project.
* Clean up stuff on Yeti.

I am checking through the recent Kenai NWR checklist draft DwC-A file using GBIF's validator (<https://www.gbif.org/tools/data-validator>). For some reason 5% of the taxa are missing genus names. Also, 189 out of 1868 records were flagged as "Distribution invalid", but I could not see what was different about these records.


```r
## Filling in missing genus values.

source("make_DWC-A.R")

sl <- dwc1$genus=="" 
spt <- strsplit(dwc1$scientificName[sl], " ")
genus <- sapply(spt, "[", 1)
dwc1_add <- dwc1[sl,]
dwc1_add$genus <- genus
fillin <- rbind(fillin, dwc1_add)
write.csv(fillin, "../data/taxonomy_fill-ins.csv", row.names=FALSE)
```

This still had the 189 distribution invalid records. I do not know what is going on here.

I worked on improving output formatting of the checlist.

Later, Ethan, Apphia, and I drove to Cohoe Beach to look for morels. I had read that there are some special morel species that grow on dunes and in grasslands, so I wanted to check the best place I know locally for these kinds of situations. We looked in the dunes and around spruces that are growing out in the dunes, but we found no morels. The dunes have recovered quite a bit since the fence was but in and vehicles have been kept off of the dunes.
