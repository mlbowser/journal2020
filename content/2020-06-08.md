### 11:00 Biology staff meeting

Steve Swenson tentatively identified the Marsh Lake Trail caterpillars as *Sunira verberata* and sent me photos from the Richardson Highway on cottonwoods in 2017. There were an outbreaks of this species in Alaska in the 2000s and in 2017 [@usda_forest_service_alaska_region_forest_2005; @usda_forest_service_alaska_region_forest_2006; @usda_forest_service_alaska_region_forest_2007; @usda_forest_service_alaska_region_forest_2008; @fs-r10-fhp_forest_2018]. I had collected this species on June 10, 2017 on the Fuller Lakes Trail (iNaturalist: [6586033](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/6586033), BOLD: [MOBIL6501-18](http://boldsystems.org/index.php/Public_RecordView?processid=MOBIL6501-18)), where I had noted that these were numerous.
