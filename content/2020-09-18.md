I sent these data to Lisa.

I drove out Swanson River Road looking for *Spirodela*.

At Weed Lake I saw no duck weeds, but I did collect a geophilomorph centipede floating on the water, apparently flooded out (iNaturalist: [60324623](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60324623); BOLD-H26).

I also saw no duck weeds at Dolly Varden Lake.

At Fish Lake I also found no duck weeds despite the wind blowing from the south. The changes due to earthworms here are amazing! There is basically no litter here despite the overstory of birch and cottonwoods and alders and *Viburnum edule*. The affected area is also large. At the shore I collected a tissue sample from a pale slug (iNaturalist: [60326105](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60326105); BOLD-ZA3).

Worm-worked soil under alders and *Viburnum edule* at Fish Lake along the trail between the campsite and the lake.

On the north side of the road across from the Fish Lake camp site, the nightcrawlers have gotten some distance into a stand of aspens and cottonwoods. The change here has been dramatic, with roots exposed and leaf litter removed. I had not seen effects of nightcrawlers in aspen stands. This is the biggest nightcrawler infestation that I have seen.

At Sucker Creek I collected more *Spirodela* (iNaturalist: [60326892](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60326892)). I saw that there were multiple stands of reed canarygrass upstream of the culvert (iNaturalist [60327151](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60327151)), so it has already escaped out of Canoe Lake.

![Reed canarygrass at the beaver dam in Sucker Creek below Sucker Lake.](2020-09-18_reed_canrygrass_at_Sucker_Creek.jpg)\
Reed canarygrass at the beaver dam in Sucker Creek below Sucker Lake.

Below the culvert I saw some silver salmon (iNaturalist: [60327513](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60327513)) and collected a rams horn snail (iNaturalist: [60327761](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60327761); BOLD-XA4).

From a tuft of plants on a rock at water line I collected a fly larva (iNaturalist: [60329563](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60329563); BOLD-8M6) and a leech (iNaturalist: [60329992](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60329992); BOLD-YK0). I found no reed canarygrass downstream, but I did not go very far.

At Merganser Lake I saw no duck weeds. The soils here were *Lumbricus* worked. I saw one immature *Lumbricus*.

I saw no duck weeds at Portage Lake or at a little pond along the way at 60.732333 N, 150.619277 W.

On the way back I stopped at another lake at 60.727215 N, 150.558883 W, where the only floating duckweed I saw was *Lemna minor* (iNaturalist: [60331267](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60331267)).
