
## Thursday, February 13

To do:

* Board of Fish meeting arrangements.
* ~~Call with Tracy~~
* Botany 2020
* ~~Draft Sandpiper SEA to DNR~~

I received LifeScanner identifications (but not sequences) for a number of submitted vials today.

I sorted Berlese sample [KNWR:Ento:11367](http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11367). This was the sparsest sample yet and took less than one hour to process.

identification|count
:---|---:
Araneae|3
Arachnida|93
Insecta|1
Collembola|8
Nematoda|1

I worked some on revising the Draft Sandpiper SEA, getting it sent out!
