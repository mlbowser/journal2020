To do:

* Intra-Service Section 7 Biological Evaluation Form

I downloaded Kittlitz's murrelet [@gbiforg_gbif_2020-5] and beluga [@gbiforg_gbif_2020-6] occurrence records from GBIF and worked on mapping these and related data for the Intra-Service Section 7 Biological Evaluation Form.

Sandpiper Lake is 59 km from the nearest occurrence of Kittlitz's murrelet, 19 miles from the nearest potential nesting habitat for Kittlitz's murrelet, 9.4 km from the nearest occurrence of belugas, and 1.4 miles from beluga critical habitat.
