
## Thursday, August 13

Jake, Colin, and I brought remaining equipment down to the floatplane dock at Headquarters Lake. Shay flew out the two canoes one at a time. Nate first took Jake and almost all of our things out to Vogel Lake on the first load. He took Colin and me on the second load.

Once at Vogel Lake cabin, we arranged our things, then loaded up herbicide application gear and took the two canoes and the Alamacraft over to Sandpiper Lake. Getting those boats through the wetlands took a while.

Once at Sandpiper Lake, we set up the outboard on the boat and then Jake and I surveyed the lake for *Elodea*. We detected *Elodea* at 3 out of 22 sites, all detections in the northernmost part of the lake.

### *Elodea* rake survey data from Sandpiper Lake on August 13. 

"Shoreward" and "lakeward" indicate rake throws away from and towards shore. Values range from a missing value for non-detections, 1 for 1â€“2 strands of *Elodea* on the rake, 2 for 3 strands to < 1/2 of the rake tines having picked up *Elodea*, and 3 indicates > 1/2 of the rake tines having picked up *Elodea*.
