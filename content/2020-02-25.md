To do:

* Board of Fish meeting travel arrangements.

I started making travel arrangements for the Board of Fisheries meeting.

I sorted Berlese sample [KNWR:Ento:11373](http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11373).

Contents:

identification|count
:---|---:
Arachnida|76
Thysanoptera|1
Aphididae|3
Coleoptera|1
Insecta|2
Hemiptera|2
Collembola|7
Araneae|1

The [KNWR:Env](https://arctos.database.museum/knwr_env) collection was created today to accomodate environmental samples beginning with soil samples from the black spruce inventory project.

I formatted and posted the *Refuge Notebook* [article from December 13, 2019](https://www.fws.gov/uploadedFiles/Region_7/NWRS/Zone_2/Kenai/Sections/What_We_Do/In_The_Community/Refuge_Notebooks/2019_Articles/Refuge_Notebook_v21_n44.pdf).

I edited this week's *Refuge Notebook* article.
