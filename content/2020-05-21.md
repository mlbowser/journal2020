## Getting a species list for our Survey123 form...
data1 <- read.csv("akepic.f8a5bcdd-1937-4de1-aae3-d7f21e7f2cac.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

species_list <- levels(as.factor(data1$scientific_name))

length(species_list)
[1] 125
 
## There were some wierd special characters.
species_list <- gsub("Â ", " ", species_list)

write.csv(species_list,
 "2020-05-21-1540_AKEPIC_KP_species_list.csv",
 row.names=FALSE
 )
