To do:

* ~~Pesticide use reporting.~~
* ~~*Refuge Notebook*.~~
* ~~Contact RTL regarding missing invoices.~~
* Catch-up from yesterday.
* Prepare for Sandpiper Lake Friday.
* Prepare for work with HEA on Thursday.
* Deal with plant specimens.
* ~~Get list of DNA sequencing equipment acquisitions to Mark.~~
* Inquire about sending Dominique's material to UAM.
* Data back-up.

I looked at the best imagery we have of Sandpiper Lake, aerial imagery captured in 2016. The patches of *Elodea* could not be seen in this imagery. I did this in response to a request in the last statewide *Elodea* meeting to find out if *Elodea* could be seen in aerial imagery.

I edited and sent out this week's *Refuge Notebook* article.

## Adding catalog numbers to the bulkloader file.

loaded <- read.csv("ArctosData_35BF9F98FD.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

data1 <- read.table("a01_Arctos_bulkload.csv", sep=",", quote="\"", header=TRUE)

loaded$uuid <- substr(loaded$OTHERCATALOGNUMBERS, 6, 41)

loaded$cat_num <- sapply(strsplit(loaded$GUID, ":"), "[", 3)

loaded <- loaded[,c("uuid", "cat_num")]

data2 <- merge(data1, loaded, all.x=TRUE)

write.csv(data2, "a01_Arctos_bulkload_v2020-08-25-1249.csv", row.names=FALSE, na="")

An aquatic plant I collected yesterday at Canoe Lake (iNaturalist: [57584513](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/57584513)) is *Caltha natans*, a species that we did not have on the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge's checklist. I processed this specimen to go into the collection ([KNWR:Herb:12445](https://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Herb:12445)).
