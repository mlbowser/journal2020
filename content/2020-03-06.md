I prepared for my Anchorage trip this week, including jump-starting and fueling up the SUV that I am to use.

I added *Cortinarius lucorum*, *Corticarina minuta*, and *Stephostethus armatulus* to the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge's checklist on FWSpecies. I worked a little on trying to fill in missing values in the taxonomy exported from FWSpecies.
