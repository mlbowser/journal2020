I saw an abandoned or feral cat at the headquarters building this morning (iNaturalist: [54647478](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/54647478)).

Annaleese and I hiked Skyline, this time with a goal looking at how the fire burned in tundra and completing CBI plots at sites where we had historical vegetation data.

We first hiked to the corrected coordinates (assuming NAD27 datum) for Paez's vegetation plots 142 and 140, but we were unable to locate the plots. From here we walked over the ridge looking into the next valley. Much of the tundra had burned here on the northeast side of the Mystery Hills.

We next walked down the southwest-facing slope to site 354-2 that I had put in in 2018 [@bowser_lab_notebook_2018; @bowser_field_2019]. Most of this plot had burned severely so that it was now mostly ash, soil, and rock, but there were unburned patches. A couple of hemlock seedlings had already gotten started.

We stopped by plot 354-2 on the way back. This had burned, also.

On the way down we observed one occurrence of a non-native plant that I had missed on Thursday, *Alopecurus pratensis*.
