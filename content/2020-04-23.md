To do:

* Slikok occupancy?
* Review Rob's pike treatment plan.

I spent much of the morning setting up and testing a PIPITS 2.5 environment [@gweon_pipits_2015] (<https://github.com/hsgweon/pipits>) and working on some tweaks to run it using exact sequence variant methods instead of the OTU clustering method that is the default.

I worked some on adding geographic extents to the metadata of the snowshow hare data in preparation for the data management early adopters' meeting.

### Data management early adopters' meeting at 13:00

* Still no specific homework.

Transferring 2019 black spruce soil fungi raw metagenomic data from the server over VPN to my laptop took a long time, but it worked in the end. I initiated a PIPITS analysis of this dataset.
