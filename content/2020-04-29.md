
## Wednesday, April 29

To do:

* ~~Submit a *Refuge Notebook* article for this week.~~

Arctos is up now, but with a restored data backup from the night of March 15. Media are still uploaded from mid April, but links to these media will need to be remade if possible.

I checked: 

Specimen record [KNWR:Ento:11382](http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11382) exists in Arctos; Specimen record [KNWR:Ento:11383](http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11383) does not. I had entered data through [KNWR:Ento:11385](http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11385). KNWR Invertebrate Collecion records [KNWR:Inv:46](http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Inv:46)â€“[KNWR:Inv:53](http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Inv:53) also no longer exist. This is frustrating.

I worked on getting Jake set up for updating the Refuge's checklist on FWSpecies.

I edited this week's *Refuge Notebook* article and sent it to the *Clarion*.

Thankfully, it looks like Arctos had uploaded data to GBIF on March 23.

There appears to be no record for [KNWR:Ento:11385](http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11385) on GBIF. I should be able to figure out which sample this was by the process of elimination.

I met with Jake over the phone about going through our Refuge's checklist to move species from our old checklist to FWSpecies.

I received a request to make my old bristletail key available, so I posted it as a preprint via ResearchGate [@bowser_key_2012].

I was able to make a search to download the GBIF version of the lost data [@gbiforg_gbif_2020-4].
