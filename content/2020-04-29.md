To do:

* Submit a *Refuge Notebook* article for this week.

Arctos is up now, but with a restored data backup from the night of March 15. Media are still uploaded from mid April, but links to these media will need to be remade if possible.

I checked: 

Specimen record [KNWR:Ento:11382](http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11382) exists in Arctos; Specimen record [KNWR:Ento:11383](http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11383) does not. I had entered data through KNWR:Ento:11385](http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11385). KNWR Invertebrate Collecion records [KNWR:Inv:46](http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Inv:46)â€“[KNWR:Inv:53](http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Inv:53) also no longer exist. This is frustrating
