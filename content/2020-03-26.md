To do:

* Blackfish analysis.
* Publish blackfish sequence data.
* Early Adopters' data management meeting at 11:00

The phylogenetic analysis from yesterday ran just fine.

For the purpose of keeping all ESV labels distinct for searchin on Arctos or combining FASTA datasets, I want to relabel at ESVs. In the output tree I relabeled "Zotu" to "bfdZotu", with "bfd" standing for "blackfish diet". Resulting output tree on iTOL: <https://itol.embl.de/tree/16415961276811585237767#>.

I worked on examining results of the blackfish work.
