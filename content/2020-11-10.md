
## Tuesday, November 10

To do:

* Posts requested by John
* ~~Review Jake's *Refuge Notebook* article.~~
* Edit this week's *Refuge Notebook* article.
* *Refuge Notebook* catch-up.

I received a copy of Tripp [-@tripp_descriptions_1955] via ARLIS. The cecidomyiid I had collected from a spruce cone yesterday is consistent with Tripp's description of *Kaltenbachiola rachiphaga* (as *Dasyneura rachiphaga*). I also received a copy of Pr√©vost [-@prevost_spruce_1990]. These descriptions are also consistent with the gall midge I had collected. I added *Kaltenbachiola rachiphaga* to the Refuge's species list.

I edited Jake's *Refuge Notebook* article.

### Biology staff meeting at 09:00

* Will work with Ben on MRDG for reed canarygrass at Sucker Lake.
* Need to talk with Leah and Steve about transition to new website.
