To do:

* Posts requested by John
* Review Jake's *Refuge Notebook* article.
* Edit this week's *Refuge Notebook* article.
* *Refuge Notebook* catch-up.

I received a copy of Tripp [-@tripp_descriptions_1955] via ARLIS. The cecidomyiid I had collected from a spruce cone yesterday is consistent with Tripp's description of *Kaltenbachiola rachiphaga* (as *Dasyneura rachiphaga*).
