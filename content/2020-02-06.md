To do:

* Sandpiper Lake *Elodea* SEA.
* ~~Help Mark with ROV testing.~~

I worked on the Sandpiper Lake *Elodea* SEA.

In the afternoon, Mark and I drove to Arc Lake, where we cut a hole in the ice and tested the QYSEA ROV. The ROV worked well, but the lake was quite dark under the ice so that we could not see much unless the ROV was on the bottom or just under the surface ice.
