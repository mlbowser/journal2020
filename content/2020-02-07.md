To do:

* ~~Sandpiper Lake *Elodea* SEA.~~

I worked on the Sandpiper Lake *Elodea* SEA, getting a draft sent out in the afternoon!

It snowed heavily this morning, but it was warm. Todd and I saw a number of live cluster flies (*Pollenia vagabunda*) on the new snow and beside the visitor center and headquarters buildings.

At the end of the day I examined specimen [KNWR:Ento:7705](http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:7705), a colletid bee. The forewing has two submarginal cells, so it should be *Hylaeus*. The only other genus reported from Alaska is *Colletes*, which has three submarginal cells [@packer_bee_genera_2007].
