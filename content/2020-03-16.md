To do:

* ~~Format *AKES Newsletter* meeting article.~~
* Deal with worm specimens from Tyler.
* Early adopter data management homework.
* Slikok occupancy.

I sorted Berlese sample [KNWR:Ento:11382](http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Ento:11382).

Contents:

identification|count
:---|---:
Oligochaeta|10
Collembola|164
Carabidae|2
Arachnida|332
Araneae|4
Thysanoptera|4
Staphylinidae|1
Insecta|4

We just received word that we are strongly advised to telework as much as possible, so I will not be getting any more lab work done for a while.

I entered data for the earthworm specimens sent to me by Tyler ([KNWR:Inv:47](http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Inv:47)â€“[KNWR:Inv:52](http://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Inv:52)).

I worked at home in the afternoon. I formatted an initial draft version of the [meeting article](https://github.com/mlbowser/AKES_Newsletter/blob/master/2020/01/meeting.tex) for the *AKES Newsletter*.

This evening I received from RTL Genomics the metagenomic sequence data from the blackfish gut contents that Apphia and I had sent in on [January 30](#thursday-january-30). I set up a project on [mBRAVE](http://www.mbrave.net/) with guesses at analysis parameters and then I uploaded the first pair of compressed FASTQ files.
