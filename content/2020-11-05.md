Examining a series of earthworms from Wasilla sent to me by Joey Slowik ([KNWR:Inv:58](https://arctos.database.museum/guid/KNWR:Inv:58)). At first I see only one adult, medium sized, about 33 mm long or so. Prostomium tanylobic. Clitellum on 27–31 or 27–32. Tubercular pubertal is on 28–31. This is a small specimen of *Lumbricus rubellus*.
