To do:

* Enter time from last week.
* *Refuge Notebook* catch-up.

I updated metadata for the snowshoe hare project to include the GBIF export scripts, metadata, etc.

I formatted *Refuge Notebook* article form April 24 through May 8.

I edited this week's *Refuge Notebook* article.

I started looking into occupancy modelling of the Slikok project data, one of the tasks I need to get done.
