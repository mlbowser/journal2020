To do:

* ~~Check out new Sruvey123 form.~~
* Finish *AKES Newsletter*.
* First aid / CPR training.
* Improve Kenai NWR checklist processing/formatting.

* Clean up stuff on Yeti.

I edited and submitted this week's *Refuge Notebook* article.

I downloaded, used, and reviewed a Survey123 form designed by Amanda for documenting non-native plant occurrence, recommending a number of changes. Most significantly, I think indicated how I think we should be integrating pesticide use reporting with the form.

I started the American Heart Association First Aid CPR AED Online training, but I did not finish it.
