I published the snowshoe hare data to <https://github.com/Kenai-NWR-bio/harepelletcounts>.

I selected several insects collected in a yellow pan trap set outside below my office window since yesterday afternoon. These included nematoceran flies (BOLD-3NVYXU5C6 and BOLD-3NW78JFI5) and two small wasps (BOLD-3NWDV1A84 and BOLD-3NW7IVLC0).

One way home I stopped at the slow stream behind Home Depot in Kenai and at a pond along K-Beach Road at 60.45524, -151.28041 looking for duckweed. I found no duckweeds, but I did collect a couple of what looked like ephydrid flies (BOLD-F41 and BOLD-7Z4).

I entered citations into Arctos for records from Hilliard and Asmund [-@hilliard_studies_1963]. I added *Asterionella formosa*, *Ceratium hirundinella*, *Chlamydomonas dinobryonii*, *Dinobryon bavaricum*, *Dinobryon borgei*,  *Dinobryon divergens*, *Dinobryon sociale*, *Dinobryon suecicum*, *Elakatothrix gelatinosa*, *Epipyxis ramosa*, *Epipyxis tabellariae*, *Fragilaria crotonensis*, *Mallomonas tonsurata*, *Melosira islandica*,  and *Salpingoeca frequentissima* to the Refuge's species list on FWSpecies based on this evidence. The names *Epipyxis gracilis*, *Epipyxis kenaiensis*, *Epipyxis planctonica*, *Epipyxis polymorpha*,  and *Synura petersenii* were not available in FWSpecies.
